**Plant Disease Prediction** is a machine learning-based project designed to identify plant diseases from leaf images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Random Forest classifiers**. The goal is to assist farmers and agriculturalists in detecting diseases early to improve crop health and yield.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Image-based plant disease classification  
- 🧠 CNN for feature extraction  
- 🌲 Random Forest for robust classification  
- 📊 Accuracy of ~95% on validation data  
- 🔍 Visual analytics for training performance  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy  
- **Model**: CNN + Random Forest  
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Dataset**: PlantVillage (38 classes, 54,000+ images)

## 📄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle with labeled images.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Image resizing, normalization, augmentation.

3. **Modeling**  
   - CNN used for feature extraction  
   - Random Forest used as the final classifier

4. **Training**  
   - 20 epochs with Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy and loss plots  
   - Confusion matrix (optional)
